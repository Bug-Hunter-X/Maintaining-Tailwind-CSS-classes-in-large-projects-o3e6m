# Maintaining Tailwind CSS Classes in Large Projects

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS in large projects: managing numerous CSS classes efficiently.  The problem is exacerbated when multiple developers work on the same project, leading to inconsistencies and difficulty in maintaining a clean and structured codebase.

The `bug.js` file illustrates a simple scenario where adding numerous padding classes can become cumbersome and prone to errors. The `bugSolution.js` file proposes a solution involving a more organized approach to defining and using Tailwind CSS classes.

## Solution

The solution involves using a more structured approach to managing the CSS classes.  This might involve:

* **Creating a separate CSS file for Tailwind classes:** This helps keep your CSS organized and easier to maintain.
* **Using a CSS preprocessor:** This can help you to write more maintainable CSS by allowing you to use variables and mixins.
* **Using a CSS framework:** This can provide you with a set of pre-built CSS classes that you can use to style your elements.

This example focuses on organizing your CSS classes to prevent inconsistencies and improve maintainability in larger projects.
